# RandTempNet_py3
Python module for handling temporal networks, original code by M. GÃ©nois adapted to python3. 

You can find the original code [here](https://github.com/mgenois/RandTempNet). I have translated the original code for it to be functioning in python3.

The code is yet to be completely tested.
